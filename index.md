## Hi

This is the personal (tech) website of Nianmin Guo.

I am a Northeastern University B.S. grad (2019), and I am an incoming Software Engineer at Plaid. I had interned at the Mass. Bay Transportation Authority (the T) as an internal tools developer recently.

There is no app here (yet). Both hitori.io and htr.io were taken, I had no choice.

I am opening an website for my non-tech stuff soon, it is called [Irregular Expression](https://irregularexpression.netlify.com).
