## Hi

This is the personal (tech) website of Nianmin Guo.

I am a Northeastern University B.S. grad (2019), currently interning at Mass. Bay Transportation Authority (the T) as an internal tools developer. 

There is no app here (yet). Both hitori.io and htr.io were taken, I had no choice.

I am opening an website for my non-tech stuff soon, it is called [Irregular Expression](https://irregularexpression.netlify.com).
