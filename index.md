## Hi

This is the personal page/blog/website of Nianmin Guo.

I am a recent Northeastern University B.S. grad, currently interning at Mass. Bay Transportation Authority (the T) as an internal tools developer. I am actively looking for full-time positions starting January 2020.

There is no app here (yet). Both hitori.io and htr.io are taken, I have no choice.
